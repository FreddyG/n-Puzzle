# n-Puzzle app

The n-Puzzle app will let you play a two-dimensional puzzle with one empty space into which some numbered tiles can slide horizontally or vertically to occupy. The goal is to arrange the board from smallest to largest.

Game features:

- the tiles will be replaced with images cropped from a larger one
- a valid move is performed when a player slides a tile either horizontally or vertically into the empty space
- the puzzle board is shuffled by preforming valid moves randomly
- There should again be a noticeable border around each tile so that no two tiles appear to be merged
- At no time should the puzzle or its pieces change aspect ratio, but the puzzle itself must still remain as large on the screen as possible

- To play, a user must be able to tap (or, if using an emulator, click) a tile immediately adjacent (directly on top, to the left, to the right, or below) to the empty space to swap that tile with that empty space. Any other taps or clicks on the puzzle itself must be ignored and should not result in a move.



Features:
- the game will have three levels of difficulty:'easy','medium' and 'hard'
- the user is presented a list of images to choose for the game
- once the user selected an image, a new activity should appear and display the preview of the solution in the game
- after three seconds the solution should disappear and in the same activity the game should appear.
- During game play, the user should be allowed to hit the MENU button on the Android device
- If the user changes the difficulty level it must cause game play to restart. Additionally, the user’s preference for difficulty level must be remembered.
- The game’s state must also survive if the user quits the app or other activities appear above it. 
- When the user has successfully solved the puzzle, a new activity must appear that congratulates the user on their accomplishment.

Frameworks, languages, libraries or other technologies implemented in this project:
    
    mockups and/or wireframes of the screens a user might encounter, and the way these are linked together.
